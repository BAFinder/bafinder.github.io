## BART: a transferrable LC retention time library for bile acids
BART is a Java program to predict gradient retention times of bile acids on different LC-MS instruments based on isocratic retention modeling. <br> 
Currently the database contains 272 bile acids measured under the following LC condition:<br> 
Column: Waters BEH C18 (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 µm)<br> 
Mobile phase A: 7.5 mM ammonium acetate (adjusted to pH 4.9 using acetic acid) in water<br> 
Mobile phase B: ACN<br> 
Flow rate: 0.45 mL/min<br> 
Column temperature: 45 ℃<br>

### Quick Start with Test Data
After extracting the contents of program and test data, change the file paths in the .bat file in the "test_data" folder according to their actual location and double click to run it. The output should be same as the "predictedRT_example.tsv" in the "test_data" folder. See User Manual for more details.
